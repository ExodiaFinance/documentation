# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of EXODIA.** Stakers stake their EXOD on [the EXODIA website](https://app.exodia.finance/#/stake) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from [bond sales](bonding.md), and can vary based on the number of EXOD staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of EXOD translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of EXOD drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your EXOD balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock EXOD and receive an equal amount of sEXOD.** Your sEXOD balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sEXOD is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sEXOD and receive an equal amount of EXOD.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked EXOD (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
