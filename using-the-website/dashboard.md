# Dashboard

On EXODIA's dashboard there are a number of statistics and methods you can use to monitor the performance of the protocol.

This is the main dashboard page which displays the current APY, EXOD holdings in your wallet, your staking and bonding balances, the current market cap of EXODIA and the treasury balance.
