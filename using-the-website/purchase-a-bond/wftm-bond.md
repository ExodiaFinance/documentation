# wFTM Bond

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have wFTM in your wallet. If you need to wrap, go [here ](https://beets.fi/#/trade/fantom/0x21be370d5312f44cb42ce377bc9b8a0cef1a4c83)and swap your FTM for wFTM.
2. Head to the [wFTM Bond page of the EXODIA website](https://app.exodia.fi/bonds/wftm). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.
3. Type in the amount of wFTM you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of EXOD you can purchase.
4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the EXODIA contract to spend your wFTM. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
6. Click "Bond" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have purchased your first wFTM bond!
