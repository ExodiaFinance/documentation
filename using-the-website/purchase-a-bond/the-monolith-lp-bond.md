# The Monolith LP Bond

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have Monolith LP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to BeethovenX and add liquidity for the [Monolith pool](https://beets.fi/#/pool/0xa216aa5d67ef95dde66246829c5103c7843d1aab000100000000000000000112) to acquire them.
2. Head to the [Monolith LP Bond page of the EXODIA website](https://app.exodia.fi/bonds/the\_monolith\_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.
3. Type in the amount of Monolith LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of EXOD you can purchase.
4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the EXODIA contract to spend your EXOD-DAI SLP tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
6. Click "Bond" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have purchased your first Monolith LP bond!
