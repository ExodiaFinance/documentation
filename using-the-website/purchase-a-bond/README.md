# Purchase A Bond

Bonds allow users to buy EXOD from the protocol at a discount by trading it with i) liquidity (LP tokens) or ii) other assets. The former is called liquidity bonds and the latter reserve bonds.

Bonds take roughly 15 epochs to vest (5 days), and EXOD tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. Liquidity bonds help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve bonds allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its RFV faster.
