# fBEETS Bond

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have fBEETS in your wallet. You can either purchase or mint fBEETS, go [here ](https://beets.fi/#/trade/fantom/0xf24bcf4d1e507740041c9cfd2dddb29585adce1e)where you can purchase BEETS, invest and then stake it to gain fBEETS or just buy fBEETS directly.
2. Head to the [fBEETS Bond page of the EXODIA website](https://app.exodia.fi/bonds/fbeets). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.
3. Type in the amount of fBEETS you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of EXOD you can purchase.
4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the EXODIA contract to spend your fBEETS. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
6. Click "Bond" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have purchased your first fBEETS bond!
