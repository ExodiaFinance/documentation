# Introduction

## What is EXODIA?

EXODIA is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the EXOD token. Each EXOD token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, FTM, gOHM) in the EXODIA treasury, giving it a backing value that it shouldn't fall below. EXODIA also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.
There is no team allocation, there was no presale. `—— In order to develop ties with Olympus and integrate the Bretton Woods v0.2 system purposed by Zeus, EXODIA will allocate a percentage of its excess reserves to purchase assets denominated in OHM.`

## What is the point of EXODIA?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the EXOD token is controlled at a high level. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that EXOD can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I participate in EXODIA?

There are two main strategies for market participants: [staking](using-the-website/stake-your-exod.md) and [bonding](using-the-website/purchase-a-bond/). Stakers stake their EXOD tokens in return for more EXOD tokens, while bonders provide LP or DAI tokens in exchange for discounted EXOD tokens after a fixed vesting period.

## How can I benefit from EXODIA?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new EXOD tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in EXOD and thus the bonder's profit would depend on EXOD price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static EXOD price.

## Who created EXODIA?

EXODIA is a fork of [**Olympus**](https://www.olympusdao.finance) on the Fantom Network. Our team is mostly anonymous, born from the DeFi Community. We aim at becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and we are actively working towards that goal.

## Who runs EXODIA?

EXODIA is DAO-governed. The core team presents the best solutions/partnerships/direction for the protocol and community express they sentiment about them through [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/exodiadao.eth) voting. 

Policies such as APY, BCV (Bond Control Variable) and DCV (Deflation Control Variable) are decided by the core team.
